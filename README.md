# Pong-Game
For building this game in python language, I have used Turtle Graphics along with cincept of OOPS.
There are three sub files along with main.py file. 
The ball.py file contains all the functionalities used fro working of ball in the game.
Similarly, The paddle.py file contains functionalities of the paddle. 
 -> The right player uses "Up" and "Down" keys on the keyboard to move his paddle. 
 -> On the other hand, the left player uses "W" key to go up and "S" to go down.
Lastly, scoreboard.py file contains the functionality of handling scores.
